Analysis of Sustainable Lifestyles and the Impact of Diet


I am currently a data science fellow studying with the NYC Data Science Academy. 

This project focuses on using Python packages and libraries to effectively analyze data and visualize insights and findings. I specifically utilized pandas, Matpplotlib and Seaborn to accomplish this.

The dataset I chose, the Sustainable Lifestyle Rating dataset found on Kaggle, was comprised of information pertaining to an individual’s overall lifestyle sustainability. Per the description from Kaggle, ‘This dataset offers a holistic view of sustainable living by examining various lifestyle choices and their environmental impact. It encompasses demographic information (age, location, gender), dietary preferences (diet type, local food frequency), transportation habits, energy sources, housing characteristics (home type, size), consumption patterns (clothing frequency, use of sustainable brands), environmental awareness, community engagement, resource consumption (electricity, water), plastic usage, waste disposal methods, and physical activity levels. Each participant's lifestyle is then evaluated and assigned a sustainability rating.’

My goal was to determine if a specific factor, in this case Diet Type, could be a relevant indicator of a person’s overall sustainability and if this factor had connection to other sustainable behaviors and choices. I was also interested in looking at demographic data, and I chose to look at Generation, using the dataset to create a new feature that grouped participants by age.  I was curious if this demographic descriptor would also indicate sustainable behavior, and what, if any, relationship it had with Diet Type.
